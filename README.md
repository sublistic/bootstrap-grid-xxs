# XXS grid for Twitter Bootstrap

This is an extra EXTRA small grid for Twitter Bootstrap 3, which allows you to target devices smaller than 480px wide (although this number can easily be changed as necessary).

## Installation

### SCSS

Save the `xxs.scss` into your current project, and then import it either into `bootstrap.scss` or into your main SCSS file.

    @import 'xxs';

---

## Usage

Use the same syntax as the regular Bootstrap grid.

    <div class="col-xxs-12 col-xs-6 col-md-3">
        ...
    </div>
